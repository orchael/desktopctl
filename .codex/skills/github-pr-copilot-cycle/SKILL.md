# GitHub PR Copilot Cycle Skill

Drive a PR from local branch to a bounded Copilot review loop. Use `gh` for GitHub operations and keep the PR branch as the single source of truth.

## Preconditions

Run from the repository root:

```bash
gh auth status
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,defaultBranchRef
git status --short
git branch --show-current
```

If the worktree has unrelated user changes, preserve them. Do not rewrite history, force-push, or delete branches unless the user explicitly asked for that.

## Create Or Update The PR

1. Confirm the branch is not the default branch.
2. Run the repo's smallest relevant tests before opening or updating the PR.
3. Push the branch:

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

4. Create the PR with Copilot requested as a reviewer:

```bash
gh pr create --fill --reviewer "@copilot"
```

For an existing PR, request or re-request Copilot review by PR number:

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number)
gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --add-reviewer "@copilot"
```

Use `@copilot` only with `--reviewer` or `--add-reviewer`. Do not use `--add-assignee`, `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`, `github-copilot[bot]`, or the requested-reviewers API as a substitute for requesting Copilot code review.

## Cycle Limit

Run at most three Copilot review cycles. A cycle is:

1. Request or re-request Copilot review.
2. Wait for Copilot review comments.
3. Score unresolved Copilot comments.
4. Fix, reply, resolve, test, push.
5. Check PR CI.

Stop before three cycles if there are no unresolved Copilot comments. Stop immediately and ask the user when any unresolved comment needs human input.

## Gather Copilot Comments

Get the current PR number and review threads:

```bash
OWNER_REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)
OWNER=${OWNER_REPO%/*}
REPO=${OWNER_REPO#*/}
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number)
gh api graphql --paginate -f owner="$OWNER" -f repo="$REPO" -F number="$PR_NUMBER" -f query='
query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!, $endCursor:String) {
  repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
    pullRequest(number:$number) {
      reviewThreads(first:100, after:$endCursor) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          path
          line
          url
          comments(first:100) {
            pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
            nodes {
              id
              author { login }
              bodyText
              url
              createdAt
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

If any returned thread has `comments.pageInfo.hasNextPage: true`, fetch the remaining comments for that thread before scoring it:

```bash
gh api graphql --paginate -f threadId="THREAD_ID" -f query='
query($threadId:ID!, $endCursor:String) {
  node(id:$threadId) {
    ... on PullRequestReviewThread {
      comments(first:100, after:$endCursor) {
        pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        nodes {
          id
          author { login }
          bodyText
          url
          createdAt
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Treat comments from `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`, `github-copilot[bot]`, or an author login containing `copilot` as Copilot comments. Only act on unresolved threads unless the user explicitly asks to revisit resolved history.

Copilot does not read replies added to its review comments. Replies are for human auditability, not for continuing a conversation with Copilot.

## Score Comments

Score each unresolved Copilot thread before changing code:

- `0 - no action`: demonstrably incorrect, obsolete after later commits, duplicate of another comment, or purely optional style that conflicts with repo policy.
- `1 - direct fix`: localized and clearly correct, with low regression risk.
- `2 - fix with validation`: likely correct but affects behavior, public output, persistence, concurrency, security controls, tests, CI, build, or generated artifacts.
- `3 - human input required`: ambiguous product intent, API contract, migration, rollout, data deletion, auth/permissions, billing, legal/compliance, security tradeoff, secret handling, or any fix that requires choosing between materially different designs.

Reply on every Copilot thread before resolving or stopping, including ignored comments. For every `0`, reply with the reason it is not being changed. For every `1` or `2`, implement the fix and reply with what changed plus the validation command. For every `3`, reply that human input is required, include the specific choice needed, then stop the cycle and ask the user for a decision with the thread URL.

## Fix And Verify

For score `1` and `2` comments:

1. Read the referenced files and surrounding code.
2. Make the smallest coherent fix.
3. Add or update tests when behavior changes or regression risk is meaningful.
4. Run targeted validation for score `1`; run broader relevant validation for score `2`.
5. Keep notes mapping each thread id to the fix and validation result.

Before pushing, check:

```bash
git status --short
git diff --check
```

Push fixes:

```bash
git push
```

## Reply And Resolve Threads

Reply to every Copilot thread, even when no code change is made:

```bash
gh api graphql -f threadId=THREAD_ID -f body='Handled in the latest push. Validation: COMMAND.' -f query='
mutation($threadId:ID!, $body:String!) {
  addPullRequestReviewThreadReply(input:{pullRequestReviewThreadId:$threadId, body:$body}) {
    comment { url }
  }
}'
```

Resolve a thread only after the code fix is pushed or after a `0` reply explains why no change is needed. Do not resolve score `3` threads while waiting for human input.

```bash
gh api graphql -f threadId=THREAD_ID -f query='
mutation($threadId:ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$threadId}) {
    thread { id isResolved }
  }
}'
```

## Check CI After Each Push

After every push:

```bash
gh pr checks --watch
```

If checks fail, inspect the failing logs, fix the root cause, run relevant validation locally, push, and re-check before requesting another Copilot review.

## Re-Request Copilot

After comments are handled and CI is green or pending with no known failures, re-request Copilot unless the cycle limit is reached:

```bash
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number)
gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --add-reviewer "@copilot"
```

Wait briefly, then gather comments again. If no unresolved Copilot threads remain, report the PR URL, cycle count, validation commands, and whether CI is green, pending, or blocked.
